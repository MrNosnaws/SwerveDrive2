todo:
WPIlib has SwerveModuleState and SwerveModulePosition objects and a kinematics section? figure out how they work
also ChassisSpeeds object?
translation2d object?
rotation2d object?
chassis speed to servemodulestate object converters? figure out how they work

all SwerveModuleStates have a static optimize(Translation2d, Rotation2d(distance)) that will do the optimizing math for us :pray:
